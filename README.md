## 1. Explain the difference between JSON, XML, and HTML!
HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, was developed as an alternative to the then-standard and much more strict SGML (Standardized General Markup Language), which wrapped content in tags in an effort to format the content that is to-be-displayed in an application. Despite being easier to use, HTML had less structure than SGML due to having lax rules regarding the tag system. This hurt the structuring of the product, because the less rules you have, the less structure you maintain. <br>
This led to the development of XML (Extensible Markup Language), which would attempt to address this issue by directly maintaining all the strict rules of SGML, thus also maintaining the stronger structure. However, this time, XML wouldn't worry about formatting at all; that would be left to HTML. XML would be responsible for the format of sending and receiving data that is saved seperately somewhere else, while HTML would be responsible for formatting and displaying said data. <br>
Though XML is still widely-used today, a new data delivery format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) became the standard as it grew in popularity due to the advancement of web application development. JSON fits better in dynamic websites, which are websites that "do" stuff instead of "show" stuff, and is also based on JavaScript, which helped in interacting fluently with programming languages. <br>
Therefore, he difference between HTML and the collective of XML and JSON is that HTML is responsible for displaying and formatting data, whereas XML and JSON is responsible for sending and receiving data. The difference between XML and JSON, on the other hand, is more complicated. <br>
XML is derived from SGML, whereas JSON is based on JavaScript. This carries many other distinctions. For one, JSON works with data types such as Boolean, String, Integer, and Null, whereas XML simply uses tags that wraps around the information, which is always a string (a <start> tag and an <end> tag is mandatory). Additionally, because JSON is not a markup language, it does not have a way to display the content, while XML does. Another one would be that JSON supports the use of arrays (native to JavaScript), while XML does not. Other differences which are not that noticeable would be that XML tends to be larger file-size-wise, and JSON tends to be less secure.<br>
