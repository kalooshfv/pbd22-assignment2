## 1. Create a diagram containing client request to the Django web application and its response. Also explain the flow of the diagram and how the urls.py, views.py, models.py and HTML files connected each other.

USER <----> DJANGO <----> URL <-----> Views <-----> Model
                                            <-----> Template
                                            
The following diagram illustrates the relations between the user and the Django framework, which applies the MVT (Model-View-Template) software pattern.

First off, MVT is a structure with 3 components, which are: <br>
  a. Models: defines the data that is stored in the database and the methods of its access <br>
  b. View: defines how models and template communicate, and is the primary logic layer of MVT <br>
  c. Template: defines how the data is served to the user and how it looks on the screen
  
Among the MVT, there is also another layer called URL (consisting of the file urls.py) that processes incoming queries from the user to the MVT structure.

The flow is as follows:
  i) 
  ii) 
  iii)
  iv)
  v)

2. Explain why do we use virtual environments? Let's say, if we do not use the virtual environments, can we still create a Django web application?
